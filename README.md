# Keyboard-Explorer-Case
3D Printed Case for the Qwiic Keyboard Explorer from Sparkfun

Please note that this design is untested at this time, print at the risk of wasting materials.

This case should fit both SKUs of the keyboard:
SPX-16184 https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16184
SPX-17251 https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17251
The only difference being which keycaps are included.

A peak array for the prototyping area is present with bosses that should accept an M3 screw.
As printer tolerances can vary, you will need to adjust the screw thread allowance (3.2) and threading diameter (3).

These designs are provided as-is, and released into the public domain without warranty or expectation of payment or recognition.
Do with them what you will.
